        <strong>Good news!</strong> In Ubuntu 14.10, your privacy should not be violated unless you opt-in to it. You'll still need to run this if you're using Ubuntu 12.10, 13.04, 13.10, or 14.04.

          If you're an Ubuntu user and you're using the default settings, each time you start
          typing in Dash (to open an application or search for a file on your computer),
          your search terms get sent to a variety of third parties, some of which advertise to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ubuntu should protect user privacy by default. Since it doesn't, you can use
          the code to the left to disable the parts of Ubuntu which are invasive to your privacy.
        </p>
        <p class="small">
          Note: This privacy problem only affects Unity. If you use GNOME
          (<code>sudo apt-get install gnome-shell</code>) or any other desktop environment,
          or if you run an Ubuntu derivative like <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a>,
          <a href="http://xubuntu.org/">Xubuntu</a>, <a href="http://www.kubuntu.org/">Kubuntu</a>, etc.,
          you won't have this problem.
