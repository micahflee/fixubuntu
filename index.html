        <p>
          If you're an Ubuntu user and you're using the default settings, each time you start
          typing in Dash (to open an application or search for a file on your computer),
          your search terms get sent to a variety of third parties, some of which advertise to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ubuntu should protect user privacy by default. Since it doesn't, you can use
          the code to the left to disable the parts of Ubuntu which are invasive to your privacy.
        </p>
        <p class="small">
          Note: This privacy problem only affects Unity. If you use GNOME
          (<code>sudo apt-get install gnome-shell</code>) or any other desktop environment,
          or if you run an Ubuntu derivative like <a href="http://www.linuxmint.com/">Linux Mint</a>,
          <a href="http://xubuntu.org/">Xubuntu</a>, <a href="http://www.kubuntu.org/">Kubuntu</a>, etc.,
          you won't have this problem.
